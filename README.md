Free-Steam just grabs games from Steam that are Free for a limited time but you will have it forever and they are quite rare so don't expect to get a free game every hour.

After your PC has booted just open the Program and look if something new is there for you then just minimize it DON'T CLOSE IT. if a new game gets free to keep you will get a Notification.
